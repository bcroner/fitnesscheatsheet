I noticed that everyone wants to create their own fitness plan, but they're all practically the same.

So what I did is put together my plan and publish it with the Creative Commons License.

This way people can add to it and modify it as they please.

If people are interested, I can offer 25-minute online coaching sessions for $50 each so that I can
answer any questions people have and give them the guidance they need. I can get you into shape. If
you're interested, feel free to reach out to me and I'll book you a coaching session. I hold a
Personal Trainer Certification from the American Council on Exercise (ACE). You can check out my
progress photos at my Instagram page at @brianedwardcroner. My personal email is seekandwander@gmail.com.
